In My case there is not potential conflict because of the following: his salary is set by an independent governing board. It is not contingent on the number of clients served. I have no input into the rates paid for services, the ability to contract with the provider or if consumers chose that provider.               The second area of concern deals with the potential to obtain confidential information for financial gain for a family member. His role as a public official offers access to confidential information necessary to administer to the needs of the people we serve. This is the same information that our other business partners have. It is not useful in anyway other than to provide supports that people have asked for. In both my role and Mr. Brinker\'s role as the administrator of a human service agency there are controls in place to ensure the highest level of confidentiality. |||||||

Wilderness Heights-shown as Final Action on S. 40th and Yankee Hill Rd.  Wilderness Heights is owned by Lincoln Federal Bank. Lincoln Federal is a partial owner of an LLC, LFSH, LLC, which LLC is a joint venture partner with Capitol Title in a business called Lincoln Title. Capitol Title Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of HomeServices of Nebraska, Inc., of which I am the Chief Operating Officer, but not an owner.|Financial benefits to the Company may be realized if the developer/owner lists the property above-described with either Woods Bros. Realty or Home Real Estate or utilizes title insurance or escrow closing services of the joint venture, Lincoln Title, in conjunction with the eventual sale of such property. Any benefit to HomeServices as a result of the joint venture with Lincoln Title would not be direct, but would simply be  a portion of overala profits/loss of the JV as determined.    At present there is not an agreement for the Developer to list these properties with a HomeServices Company and there are not any Lincoln Federal lots currently with Home or Woods Bros. Because there is no current agreement, I am uncertain when or whether such properties may in the future be listed with a HomeServices Company. If listings were with an agent on the 100% commission plan the Company would not receive any direct monetary commission benefit other than a small broker\'s administrative commission on the first two transacions each year. 100% agents keep the total of their commission and pay a non-varying flat marketing fee to the company rather than splitting commission.    Any benefit to the Company as a result of a Buyer\'s use of a HOME or Woods agent, or use of Capitol Title is purely speculative and the nature of any such benefit would be dependent upon the agent who was involved in such transaction.||||1|Home Services of NE, Inc.|

As part of this process, Section 4, now codified as 79-1104.01, requires that the NE Dept. of Education (NDE) select and enter into an agreement with an endowment provider.  It is my understanding that the NE Children and Families Foundation (NCFF) of which I am a board member, anticipates submitting a proposal to NDE to be selected as the endowment provider.  Under Section 2 of Article VII of the NE Constitution and 79-301(1), the NDE is composed of the State Board of Education and the Commissioner of Education.  Therefore, both the Commissioner and the State Board of Education, of which I am a member, will be required to approve the aggreement with the endowment provider.  The State Board may also vote on the selection of the endowment provider.  These actions will most likely take place at the December 2006 Board Meeting.  It is my understanding that the NCFF will benefit financially, directly or indirectly, if it is selected and enters into an agreement with NDE to be the endowment provider.

I, Gary Hamer, in my position as Deputy Director of the Department, was going to serve on the proposal evaluation committee, and participate in the final selection of a contractor to carry out the functions of the Act. However, one of the potential bidders is a corporatin known as Invest Nebraska. I am currently serving, in an appointed position, as a director on the board of such organization.    As a result of my business association with Invest Nebraska, I will be removed from the porposal evaluation committee and will no longer participate in the final selection of a contractor. I will also refrain from participating in the development of a proposal for submission to the Department of Economic Development on behalf of Invest Nebraska. |In the event that Invest Nebraska does submit a bid in response to the RFP, and in the event that Invest Nebraska is selected through the public bidding process to be awarded the contract, Invest Nebraska would be awarded $250,000 each year, for two years (provided that Invest Nebraska could satisfy the matching requirements). There would be no personal financial benefit. I do not receive a salary ro any fees for my membership on the board. |1|||1|Invest Nebraska|

I have no doubt that this would certainly be a conflict of Interest if we were trying to sell the building or tear it douwn and re-hab it. However, this is not the case since the landlord has already remodeled the building and prefers to rent it out. I have never had a prospective tenant that inquired about blight and TIF districts or made a decision on that basis, and declaring the neighborhood blighted bould not result in any higher rents for the landlord nor higher commissions for me. Generally, however , tenants DO ask if ownership might be a possibility at some point, so we do say in our advertising that the owner would consider selling it, although we do not officially have it listed for sale at this time. I would like to see if this is a conflict of interest and if I should abstain from voting.

On the October 21, 2009, draft agenda for the Planning Commission, there are two applications for auto dealerships within one mile of DuTeau. A new dealership at S. 33rd Street and Yankee Hill Road (Special Permit 09022 and Change of Zone 09025) and the expansion of a dealership at S. 27th Street and Tamarin Ridge Road (Special Permit 07015A). The new dealership at Yankee Hill Road is approximately one mile southeast of DuTeau and the dealership on S. 27th Street is directly across the street to the west of DuTeau.    DuTeau Chevrolet Subaru is in the process of acquiring land for the relocation of the Subaru franchise. Our original plans were to acquire the land at S. 27th Street and Tamarin Ridge Road but we were unsuccessful. This is the same parcel of land covered by Special Permit 07015A and scheduled for hearing on October 21st.    Due to my history with S. 27th and Tamarin Ridge Road and the proximity of both auto dealership applications, I would feel most comfortable declaring a conflict of interest.|Proximity of competing auto dealerships.

The DSC would involve a new methodology in City interaction with the development community and/or construction and remodeling of new space in the City-County Building and co-location of several departments or representatives from several departments.    The DSC concept was presented to the Lincoln/Lancaster County Public Building Commission with a request to have the construction started. The Public Building Commission asked the Mayor to first get approval from the Lincoln City Council, which is now being instigated with an informational meeting on June 29, 2009.    Secondary to the DSC is the possibility the City will relocate part or all of its Urban Development Department to the City-County Building to be close to the DSC. The Urban Development lease with Haymarket Square expires on February 28, 2010.    The question is whether discussion on the creation of the Development Services Center creates a conflict of interest for Jon Camp, who, through his ownership in Haymarket Square Partnership, currently leases space to the Urban Development. The Lease for Urban Development terminates on February 28, 2010, unless the City exercises its option to renew.    The issue is whether a DSC should be created.    The City of Lincoln can relocate the Urban Development Department regardless of whether the DSC is created.    Thus, can Jon Camp participate in discussions concerning the Development Services Center?     |Jon Camp is a majority partner in Haymarket Square Developers, a general partnership. Haymarket Square currently leases office space to the City of Lincoln\'s Urban Development Department under a lease that expires February 28, 2010. The City of Lincoln has six one-year renewal options, exercisable solely at the discretion of the City.|1||Jon Camp|1|Haymarket Square|

Pinewood Bowl is an outdoor entertainment facility that accommodates 3,000 or more patrons for activities such as musical events or plays.  Pinewood Bowl is located in Pioneers Park, a City-owned facility.    The Pioneers Park Nature Center is located in a portion of City-owned Pioneers Park and has the ability to serve functions of approximately 80 individuals. It is located near wildlife pastures with such animals at North American Bison    Auld Pavilion is a dance hall constructed in the 1920s or 1930s that accommodates functions up to approximately 20 individuals.  Auld Pavilion is City-owned and located in Antelope Park, west of Capitol Blvd. and 33rd Street, adjacent to children\'s playgrounds and picnic shelters.    Jon Camp has served on the Lincoln City Council for 12 years since May 1999.    Jon Camp started redeveloping properties in Lincoln\'s Historic Haymarket in August 1982 and continues to do so.    Jon Camp owns properties located in Lincoln\'s Historic Haymarket through the Haymarket Square Partnership (HMS), the CH, LTD Corporation (CH Ltd.) and the AJC Investments, LLC (AJC).  These properties include 9 buildings that are utilized for commercial, retail, and office spaces.  Within two buildings are three reception facilities: (1) the Ridnour Room, (2) North Apothecary Loft, and (3) South Apothecary Loft.    The Apothecary Lofts have master bedroom suites making them unique and different from other venues in Lincoln.  The Ridnour Room is a reception facility that can accommodate 300 guests.  All three facilities are different than other venues because no food nor beverage catering is provided by CH, Ltd.|The matter before the Lincoln City Council raises the question of whether permitting alcohol at City Park facilities will have financial impact or effect on the business of Jon Camp.    First, within the City of Lincoln, there are a wide variety and number of facilities offering reception rooms that will have minimal, if any financial impact on Jon Camp\'s three facilities. This includes venues like golf courses, restaurants with party rooms, pure reception facilities, and hotels and motels with reception areas.    Second, the targeted clientele of Mr. Camp\'s three facilities represent a different demographic due to the pricing structure and quality of the facilities.    Third, features offered by the Apothecary Lofts are different that those of the City because the Apothecary Lofts also are more similar to lodging facilities.  In fact, CH, Ltd. charges \"lodging taxes\" on overnight stays.    Fourth, the Apothecary Lofts and the Ridnour Room are unique because guests have complete freedom and flexibility to handle food and beverage service as they desire.  Facility hosts can even bring in their own food and beverages.    The NADC should consider whether ownership of Mr. Camp of properties in the Historic Haymarket will incur financial gains or losses due to the addition of alcohol.  Mr. Camp\'s properties are located in Lincoln\'s Historic Haymarket, which is several miles away from the Auld Pavilion and much further way from Pinewood Bowl and the Nature Center, both of which are located in Pioneers Park.    Because the Auld Pavilion and the Nature Center already market to weddings and other activities, will there be financial gain/loss to Mr. Camp beyond any financial gain/loss that currently exists.    Because Mr. Camp commenced his development in Historic Haymarket in 1982, he has provided leadership in the modern era of Haymarket and continues to do so.  However, to disqualify Mr. Camp from considering a project before the Lincoln City Council should be analyzed on an individual basis, which is the purpose of this application.    In this particular case, the existence of a very competitive market for reception facilities insulates Mr. Camp from any real conflict of interest in this present matter.|1|||1|Haymarket Square CH, Ltd|

I am a member of the school board and also a local substitute. The Elementary School secretary makes calls to fill the substitute positions for the district. I was approved as a local sub this past year and so renewed a previous certificate that I had let expire when I was running a restaurant. I have asked the secretary to only call me if they are unable to find anyone else as we have a farming and ranching operation that takes most of my time and energy.  The farm is our livlihood. When I am gone from the farm it puts a hardship on my husband and he usually hires someone to help him if I am going to be gone. The school was in need of a \"long term\" sub to fill in while the preschool teacher was out on maternity leave. They could not find anyone so I told them I would fill the morning(preschool) position if they could find someone else to take her afternoon duties at the high school as I could not be away from the farm all day.  They were able to find a retired teacher who was willing to take the afternoon duties  but did not want anything to do with the preschool. I did fill in for 5 1/2 weeks in October and November, mornings only, while the teacher was out on leave. We have a split board and other members of the board believe that sine I have a \"financial interest\' because I am \"employed\" by the district that I should not be able to vote when it comes time for renewing the Superintendent\'s contract.  My husband hired two people to help him while I was in town substituting. I feel like I was doing my community a service and was not in it \"for the money\" as it cost us $18 per hour to hire the help while I was gone. I believe in helping my school and my community when needed and would like to be able to make myself available when the school is in a crunch but I don\'t want to interfere with my duties on the board. I would like your opinion as to whether this constitutes a conflict of interest with my duties as a board member and whether I need to abstain when voting on issues dealing with the superintendent|I don\'t believe there is a financial benefit because of the payout for farm help but I did receive substitute pay for the time I spent filling in for the preschool teacher.  I do not see any long term benefit since I always ask them to try to find someone else and to only call me as a last resort. We have hired several more local subs in the past month and a half so there should be a larger pool for them to call before they would call me.    Two of the board members also have wives who are local subs and fill in pretty regularly. One of the wives was not called in this instance because they like to use her at the high school because she is a better fit there and I did see her several times during the time I was filing in.  Her husband and his best buddy on the board are the main ones questioning whether I should be able to vote. The other board members wife was called but she turned it down because they were harvesting corn. Several other subs I spoke with also turned it down because of the timing-most are involved with farming and ranching in some way and fall is a very busy time for us all.|1|||||

Sen. Galen Hadley introduced a bill this legislative session, LB 872, which amends Neb. Rev. Stat. $77-2734.04 and 77-2734.14 to define terms and to change provisions relating to the apportionment of income between states for the purposes of taxation. The intent of the bill, according to Sen. Hadley, is to provide that for purposes of income taxation, the sale of intangibles and services be treated the same as current Nebraska law treats the sale of manufactured and retail tangible goods and imposes the state income tax based on a market-based source of income approach rather than the current \"all or nothing\" cost of performance approach. According to the Nebraska Department of Revenue, LB 872 will increase corporate income tax for corporations located outside of Nebraska that provide services or intangibles to customers located in Nebraska (LB 872 Fiscal Note, dated January 25, 2012).    At the public committee hearing for LB 872 on January 27, 2012, the Nebraska Broadcasters Association raised concerns with the bill. It is my understanding that the Association is now working on a proposed amendment that would exempt broadcast companies from the scope of this bill. |As a part owner of two radio stations in Nebraska, the passage of this bill in its original form could result in a change in both the availability and cost of the services or intangibles consumed by my businesses that come from providers outside of the State.   |1|||1|KUSO-FM and KNEN-FM|If you will not abstain from acting on a matter state why, despite the potential conflict, you intend to vote or otherwise participate.

Those activities, if our proposal is accepted, would include work on real estate forms and reporting on and tracking development in the City of Lincoln.  As I understand it the Realtors Association makes no formal applications of its own to the Planning Commission for development but occasionally weighs in on policy decisions like comprehensive planning by writing letters stating their position and occasionally testifying.  I do not believe our firm\'s work would involve assistance with those policy matters.|Retainer payment to my law firm||||1|Knudsen, Berkheimer, Richardson|

My family are stockholders in companies that are primarily engaged in the production and sale of natural gas and oil products.  The construction or rerouting of the XL pipeline may have an impact on price of stocks we hold though it is impossible to determine whether it would be a positive or negative impact.||1|1|Ann Ashford, Thomas Ashford|||
